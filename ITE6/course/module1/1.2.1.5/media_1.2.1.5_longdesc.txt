The figure on this page shows two tables. The first table lists the following various Intel sockets and their supported processor architecture. Intel Socket: 775, Architecture: Land Grid Array (LGA). Intel Socket: 1155, Architecture: LGA. Intel Socket: 1156, Architecture: LGA. Intel Socket: 1150, Architecture: LGA. Intel Socket: 1366, Architecture: LGA. Intel Socket: 2011, Architecture: LGA. The second table lists the following various AMD sockets and their supported processors. AMD Socket: AM3, Architecture: Pin Grid Array (PGA). AMD Socket: AM3+, Architecture: PGA. AMD Socket: FM1, Architecture: PGA. AMD Socket: FM2, Architecture: PGA. AMD Socket: FM2+, Architecture: PGA. Figure 2 on this page is a table listing several factors and considerations affecting the choice of a CPU cooling system. Socket type: The heat sink or fan type must match the socket type of the motherboard. Motherboard physical specifications: The heat sink or fan must not interfere with any components attached to the motherboard. Case size: The heat sink or fan must fit within the case. Physical environment: The heat sink or fan must be able to disperse enough heat to keep the CPU cool in warm environments.
