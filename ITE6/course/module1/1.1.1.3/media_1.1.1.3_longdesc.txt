Figure 1 on this page is a table listing the following four basic units of electricity. Electrical Unit: Voltage (V), Measured In: Volts (V), Description: This is a measure of work required to move a charge from one location to another, a computer power supply usually produces several different voltages. Electrical Unit: Current (I) , Measured In: Amperes, or Amps (A), Description: This is a measure of the amount of electrons moving through a circuit per second, computer power supplies deliver different amperages for each output voltage. Electrical Unit: Resistance (R), Measured In: Ohms (O), Description: This refers to the opposition to the flow of current in a circuit, lower resistance allows more current to flow through the circuit, a good fuse has low resistance or almost 0 ohms. Electrical Unit: Power (P), Measured In: Watts (W), Description: This is a measure of work required to move electrons through a circuit (voltage), multiplied by the number of electrons going through that circuit per second (current), computer power supplies are rated in watts. Figure 2 on this page is an image of the back of a dual voltage power supply showing the power cable socket, the on/off switch, and the 110V to 115V voltage selector switch. Figure 3 on this page is an image of the inside components of a power supply, highlighting the capacitors.
