Figure 1 on this page shows images of the following four adapter cards. A Sound Adapter, a Network Interface Card (NIC), a Redundant Array of Independent Disks adapter (RAID), a Video Adapter. Figure 2 on this page is an interactive graphic that explains the difference between the following types of expansion slots. Name: PCI, Description: Peripheral Component Interconnect is a 32-bit or 64-bit expansion slot. It is currently found in many computers. It is found on most motherboards. Name: Mini PCI, Description: This is smaller version of PCI for laptops. Mini PCI has three different form factors; Type I, Type II, and Type III. Name: PCI-X, Description: PCI eXtended is an updated version of the standard PCI.  It uses a 32-bit bus with higher bandwidth than the PCI bus. PCI-X can operate up to four times faster than PCI. Name: PCIe, Description: PCI Express uses a serial bus that has higher throughput and many other improvements over the older expansion slots. PCIe has x1, x4, x8, and x16 slots which vary in length from shortest to longest, respectively. Shown here are the two most common sizes, x1 at the top and x16 at the bottom.
