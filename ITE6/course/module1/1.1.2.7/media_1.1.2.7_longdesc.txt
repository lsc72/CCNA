Figure 1 on this page is an interactive graphic that explains the difference between the following types of memory modules. Name: DIP, Description: Dual Inline Package is an individual memory chip. A DIP has dual rows of pins used to attach it to the motherboard. Name: SIMM, Description: Single Inline Memory Module is a small circuit board that holds several memory chips. SIMMs have 30-pin or 72-pin configurations. Name: DIMM Memory, Description: Dual Inline Memory Module is a circuit board that holds SDRAM, DDR SDRAM, DDR2 SDRAM, and DDR3 SDRAM chips. There are 168-pin SDRAM DIMMs, 184-pin DDR DIMMs, and 240-pin DDR2 and DDR3 DIMMs. Name: SODIMM, Description: Small Outline DIMM has a 72-pin and 100-pin configurations for support of 32-bit transfers or a 144-pin, 200-pin, and 204-pin configurations for support of 64-bit transfers. This smaller, more condensed version of DIMM provides random access data storage that is ideal for use in laptops, printers, and other devices where conserving space is desirable. Figure 2 on this page is an interactive graphic that explains the difference between the following common types of cache memory. Name: L1, Description: L1 cache is internal cache and is integrated into the CPU. Name: L2, Description: L2 cache is external cache and was originally mounted on the motherboard near the CPU. L2 cache is now integrated into the CPU. Name: L3, Description: L3 cache is used on some high-end workstations and server CPUs. Figure 3 on this page is an interactive graphic that explains the difference between the following types of error checking. Name: Nonparity, Description: Nonparity memory does not check for errors in memory. Name: Parity, Description: Parity memory contains eight bits for data and one bit for error checking. The error-checking bit is called a parity bit. Name: ECC, Description: Error Correction Code memory can detect multiple bit errors in memory and correct single bit errors in memory.
