The figure on this page is a topology that shows three ISPs connected to the internet. Each Isp has a router DHCP server. An ISP DHCP server is also connected to the internet. A mobile worker is connected to ISP 1 using wireless. A corporate network is shown with three desktop computers connected to Switch1 and three other desktop computers connected to Switch2, which is connected to Switch1. Switch2 is also connected to a local DHCP server. Switch1 is connected to a router, which is connected to ISP2. A home and small business network is shown with three desktop computers connected to a wireless router, which is connected to ISP 3. The mobile worker and all the desktop computers are labelled as, ‘DHCP Clients”. Figure 2 on this page is a diagram that shows the DHCP client sending a DHCP Discover (DHCPDISCOVER) message to a DHCP server requesting an IP address. The server sends a DHCP Offer (DHCPOFFER) message back to the client offering an IP address. The client sends a DHCP Request (DHCPREQUEST) message back to the server selecting an IP address. The server sends a DHCP Pack (DCHPACK) message back to the client acknowledging the selected IP address.
