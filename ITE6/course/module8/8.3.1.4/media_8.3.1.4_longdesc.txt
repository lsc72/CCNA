The figure on this page is a diagram that shows the following three main Cloud services models and IT support for each of the Cloud computing services. Software as a Service (SaaS), the cloud provider is responsible for access to services, such as email, communication, and virtual desktops that are delivered over the internet. Platform as a Service (PaaS), the cloud provider is responsible for access to the development tools and services used to deliver the applications. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), the cloud provider is responsible for access to the network equipment, virtualized network services, and supporting network infrastructure. IT as a Service (ITaaS), the cloud provider is responsible for IT support for IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS service models. In the ITaaS model, an organization contracts with the cloud provider for individual or bundled services.
