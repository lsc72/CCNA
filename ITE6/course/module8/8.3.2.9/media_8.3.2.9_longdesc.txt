Figure 1 on this page is a topology that shows a person sitting at a desktop computer connected the cloud. A desktop computer labelled as, ‘Management Console’ is connected to an IDS – enabled Sensor. The IDS – enabled Sensor is connected to Switch1. A laptop labelled as, ‘Target’ is connected to a Router1. Router1 is also connected to the Switch1. Switch1 is connected to Router2. Router2 is connected to the cloud. The figure shows that the IDS – enabled Sensor analyses the traffic before forwarding it to the Management Console. Whereas, the laptop receives the traffic directly. Figure 2 on this page is a topology that shows a person sitting at a desktop computer connected the cloud. A desktop computer labelled as, ‘Management Console’ is connected to Router1. A laptop labelled as, ‘Target’ is also connected to a Router1. Router1 is connected to an IPS – enabled Sensor. A bit Bucket is also connected to the IPS – enabled Sensor. The IPS – enabled Sensor is connected to Router2. Router2 is connected to the cloud. The figure shows that the IPS – enabled Sensor analyses the traffic before forwarding it to the Management Console and the laptop.
