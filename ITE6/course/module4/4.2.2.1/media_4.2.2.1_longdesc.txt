Figure 1 on this page is a table listing the following common problems and solutions for storage devices. Identify the Problem: The computer does not recognize a storage device, Probable Cause: The power cable is loose, the data cable is loose, the jumpers are set incorrectly, the storage device has failed, the storage device settings in BIOS are incorrect, Possible solution: Secure the power cable, secure the data cable, reset the jumpers, replace the storage device, reset the storage device settings in BIOS. Identify the Problem: The computer fails to recognize an optical disc, Probable Cause: The disc is inserted upside down, there is more than one disc inserted in the drive, the disc is damaged, the disc is in the wrong format, the optical drive is faulty, Possible Solution: Insert the disc correctly, ensure that there is only one disc inserted in the drive, replace the disc, use the correct type of disc, replace the optical drive. Identify the Problem: The computer will not eject the optical disk, Probable Cause: The optical drive is jammed, the optical drive has been locked by software, the optical drive is faulty, Possible Solution: Insert a pin in the small hole next to the eject button on the drive to open the tray, reboot the computer, replace the optical drive. Identify the Problem: The computer does not recognize a removable external drive, Probable Cause: The removable external drive is not seated properly, the external ports are disabled in the BIOS setting, the removable external drive is faulty, Possible Solution: Remove and re-insert the drive, enable the ports in the BIOS setting, replace the removable external drive. Identify the Problem: A media reader cannot read a memory card that works properly in the camera, Probable Cause: The media reader does not support the memory card type, the media reader is not connected correctly, the media reader is not configured properly in the BIOS settings, Possible Solution: Use a different memory card type, ensure the media reader is connected correctly in the computer, reconfigure the media reader in the BIOS settings, install a known good media reader. Identify the Problem: Retrieving or saving data from the USB flash drive is slow, Probable Cause: The motherboard does not support USB 3.0, the port is set to full speed in the BIOS settings, Possible Solution: Update the motherboard or USB flash drive to support USB 3.0m, set the port speed in the BIOS setting to high speed.Figure 2 on this page is a table listing the following common problems and solutions for motherboards and internal components. Identify the Problem: The clock on the computer is no longer keeping the correct time or the BIOS settings are changing when the computer is rebooted, Probable Cause: The CMOS battery may be loose, the CMOS battery may be failing, Possible Solution: Secure the battery, replace the battery. Identify the Problem: After updating the BIOS firmware, the computer will not start, Probable Cause: The BIOS firmware update did not install correctly, Possible Solution: Contact the motherboard manufacturer to obtain a new BIOS chip. (if the motherboard has two BIOS chips the second BIOS chips can be used.). Identify the Problem: The computer displays the incorrect CPU information when the computer boots, Probable Cause: The CPU settings are not correct in the advanced BIOS setting, BIOS does not properly recognise the CPU, Possible Solutions: Set the advanced BIOS settings correctly for the CPU, update the BIOS. Identify the Problem: The hard drive LED on the front of the computer does not light, Probable Cause: The hard drive LED cable is not connected or is loose, the hard drive LED cable is incorrectly oriented to the front case panel connections, Possible Solution: Reconnect hard drive LED cable to motherboard, correctly orient the hard drive LED cable to the front case panel connection and reconnect. Identify the Problem: The built in NIC has stopped working on a computer, Probable Cause: The NIC hardware has failed, Possible Solution: Add a new NIC to an open expansion slot. Identify the Problem: The computer does not display any video after installing a new PCIe video card, Probable Cause: BIOS settings are set to use the built-in video, the cable is still connected to the built-in video, the new video card is faulty, Possible Solution: Disable the built in video-in the BIOS settings, connect the cable to the new video card, the new video card needs auxiliary power, connect any required power connectors to the video card, install a known good video card. Identify the Problem: The new sound card does not work, Probable Cause: The speakers are not connected to the correct jack, the audio is muted, the sound card is faulty, BIOS settings are set to use the on board sound device, Possible Solution: Connect the speakers to the correct jack, unmute the audio, install a known good sound card, disable the on board audio device in the BIOS settings.Figure 3 on this page is a table listing the following common problems and solutions for power supplies. Identify the Problem: The computer will not turn on, Probable Cause: The computer is not plugged in to the AC outlet, the AC outlet is faulty, the power cord is faulty, the power supply switch is not turned on, the power supply switch is set to the incorrect voltage, the power button is not connected correctly to the front panel connector, the power supply has failed, Possible Solution: Plug the computer into a known good AC outlet, use a known good power cord, turn on the power supply switch, set the power supply switch to the correct voltage setting, correctly orient the power button to the front case panel connector and reconnect, install a known good power supply. Identify the Problem: The computer reboots, turns off unexpectedly; or there is smoke or the smell of burning electronics, Probable Cause: The power supply is starting to fail, Possible Solution: Replace the power supply.Figure 4 on this page is a table listing the following common problems and solutions for CPUs and memory. Identify the Problem: The Computer will not boot or it locks up, Probable Cause: The CPU has overheated, the CPU fan is failing, the CPU has failed. Possible Solutions: Reinstall the CPU, Replace the CPU fan, add fan(s) to the case, replace the CPU. Identify the Problem: The CPU fan is making an unusual noise, Probable Cause: The CPU fan is failing, Possible Solution: Replace the CPU fan. Identify the Problem: The computer reboots without warning, locks up, or displays error messages, Probable Cause: The front-side bus is set too high, the CPU multiplier is set too high, the CPU voltage is set too high, Possible Solution: Reset to the factory default settings for the motherboard, lower the front-side bus settings, lower the multiplier settings, lower the CPU voltage settings. Identify the Problem: After upgrading from a single core CPU to a dual core CPU, the computer runs more slowly and only shows one CPU graph in the Task Manager, probable Cause: The BIOS does not recognise the dual core CPU, Possible Solution: Update the BIOS firmware to support the dual core CPU. Identify the Problem: A CPU will not install onto the motherboard, Probable Cause: The CPU is the incorrect type, Possible Solution: Replace the CPU with a CPU that matches the motherboard socket type. Identify the Problem: The computer does not recognise the RAM that was added, Probable Cause: The new RAM is faulty, the incorrect type of RAM was installed, the RAM that has been added is not the same type of RAM that is already installed, the new RAM is loose in the memory slot, Possible Solution: Replace the RAM, install the correct type of RAM, secure the RAM in the memory slot. Identify the Problem: After upgrading Windows, the computer runs very slowly, Probable Cause: The computer does not have enough RAM, the video card does not have enough memory, Possible Solution: Install additional RAM, install a video card that has more memory.
