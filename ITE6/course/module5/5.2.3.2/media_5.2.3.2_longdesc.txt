The figure on this page is an interactive activity that checks the learnerâ€™s understanding of the following BIOS Boot Process Order. Step 1, POST. Step 2, BIOS locates and reads the configuration settings that are stored in the CMOS memory. Step 3, the BIOS boots the computer using the first drive that contains a valid boot sector. Step 4, the code in the boot sector is executed and the control of the boot process is given to Windows Boot Manager. Step 5, WinLoad uses the path specified in BOOTMGR to find the boot partition. Step 6, WinLoad loads two files that make up the core of Windows: NTOSKRNL.EXE and HAL.DLL. Step 7, WinLoad reads the registry files, chooses a hardware profile, and loads the device drivers. Step 8, the Windows kernel takes over the boot process. Step 9, NTOSKRNL.EXE starts the login file called WINLOGON.EXE. Step 10, WINLOGON.EXE displays the Windows Welcome screen.
