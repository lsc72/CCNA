The figure on this page is a diagram that represents the operating system. The diagram shows four boxes stacked vertically. The first box is labelled as, ‘User’, the second box is labelled as, ‘Application’, the third box is labelled as, ‘Operating System’, and the fourth box is labelled as, ‘Hardware’. Between each box is an up arrow and a down arrow that represent the flow of information through the system. Information flows from the user to the application then to the operating system and then to the hardware. A response to the Information then flows back from the hardware to the operating system then to the application and then back to the user.
