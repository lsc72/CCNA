The figure on this page is a diagram that represents the following disk arrays. Disk Array: Spanned Volume, Description: The data is written sequentially. Each volume spans across multiple disks when more storage space is needed. Disk Array: Striped Volume, Description: The data is divided and stored across disks for faster read and write access. Disk Array: Mirrored Volume, Description: The data is written to multiple disks at the same time to ensure fault tolerance. Disk Array: Raid 5 Volume, Description: The data is divided and stored across disks with parity to ensure fault tolerance.
