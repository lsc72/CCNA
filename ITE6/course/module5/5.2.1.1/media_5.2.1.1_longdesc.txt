Figure 1 on this page is an interactive graphic that explains the following components of a hard drive. Hard Drive Component: Actuator Shaft, Description: The actuator shaft holds the actuator arm and acts as a rotation point. Hard Drive Component: Actuator Arm, Description: The actuator arm holds the read/write head and moves it between tracks on the platter. Hard Drive Component: Spindle, Description: The spindle holds the platters and spins them. Hard Drive Component: Platters/Disks, Description: Platters are disks coated with magnetic media.Figure 2 on this page is an interactive graphic that explains the following structure of a hard drive platter. Platter Section: Track, Description: A track is one complete circle on one side of platter where data is written and read. A track is broken into multiple sectors. Platter Section: Cluster, Description: A cluster is a group of sectors allocated for data storage. The file system allocates clusters for storage because most files are larger than one sector. Platter Section: Sector, Description: A sector is a portion of a track that contains synchronization information, data, and error correcting code (ECC). Platter Section: Cylinder, Description: A cylinder is where tracks are in alignment above and below each other on many platters. Platter Section: Intersector Gap, Description: This is the gap which defines the boundaries between sectors. Platter Section: Intertrack Gap, Description: This is the gap which defines the boundaries between tracks. Platter Section: Synchronisation Information, Description: This is the header information and data used by the drive and the controller to help with data storage. The synchronisation information and data form the first two parts of the intertrack gap. Platter Section: Error Correcting Code (ECC), Description: This code helps to verify that the data in the sector was written correctly. The ECC forms the third part (trailer) of the intertrack gap.
