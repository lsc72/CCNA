The figure on this page is a table listing the following differences between the 32-bit and 64-bit Windows architectures. Architecture: 32-bit (x86-32), Description: Processes multiple instructions using a 32 bit address space, supports 32-bit operating system, supports maximum of 4 Gb of RAM memory. Architecture: 64-bit (x86-64), Description: Adds additional registers specifically for instructions that use a 64-bit address space, is backward compatible with the 32-bit processor, supports 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems.
