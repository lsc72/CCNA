A desktop computer labelled as, ‘Print server File client’ is also connected to the switch. A printer is directly connected to the print server file client. The Print client file server has a callout saying, “I have files on my hard drive that are being shared for Peer2. I also have a page that I need to print through Peer2.” The print server file client has a callout saying, “I need to access a file from the hard drive on Peer1. I also need to print a file that I received from Peer1, with a print request.”
