Figure 1 on this page is an image of the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties dialog box that shows that when a host is configured with an IPv4 address, it is entered in the following dotted decimal format: 192.168.200.8. Figure 2 on this page is a diagram that demonstrates how to convert a binary address into dotted decimal notation as follows. IPv4 address in binary notation: 11000000.10101000.11001000.00001000. Each octet has eight bits and each bit represents a number. The place values for each bit in an octet are: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. All bits with the value “1” are added together. The first octet in the IPv4 address is: 11000000. The first two bits to the right have values of “1”. Therefore, add 128 and 64 which equals 192. When all the octets are calculated the dotted decimal notation is: 192.168.200.8. Figure 3 on this page is a table that shows the following IPv4 address and Subnet mask converted to their binary equivalents. Dotted Decimal: 192.168.200.8, Network Portion: 11000000.10101000.11001000, Host Portion: .00001000. Dotted Decimal: 255.255.255.0, Network Portion: 11111111.11111111.11111111, Host Portion: .00000000. Dotted Decimal: 192.168.200.0, Network Portion: 11000000.10101000.11001000, Host Portion: .00000000.
