Figure 1 on this page is a topology that represents a client-server network showing a file server and client download example. The topology shows a smartphone, an IP phone, and a desktop computer labelled as ‘Client’ connected over a network to a server. Below the server are icons of three files. Above the network icon is an arrow labelled as, ‘Download’ pointing from the server to the connected devices. Files are downloaded from the server to the client. Resources are stored on the server. A client is a hardware/software combination that people use directly. Figure 2 on this page is a topology that represents a client-server network showing a file server and client upload example. The topology is the same as in figure 1 except that the arrow is below the network icon and is labelled as, ‘Upload’ pointing from the connected devices to the server. Files are uploaded from the client to the server for storage. Resources are stored on the server. A client is a hardware/software combination that people use directly.
