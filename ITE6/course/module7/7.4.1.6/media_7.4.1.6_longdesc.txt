Figure 1 on this page is a diagram that shows the following fully expanded IPv6 addresses: 2001:0DB8:0000:1111:0000:0000:0000:0200, FE80:0000:0000:0000:0123:4567:89AB:CDEF, FF02:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001.Figure 2 on this page is a diagram that demonstrates how to compress an IPv6 address by omitting leading zeros as follows: Fully expanded, 2001:0DB8:0000:1111:0000:0000:0000:0200. No leading zeroes, 2001:DB8:0:1111:0:0:0:200 Compressed, 2001:DB8:0:1111::200. Figure 3 on this page is a diagram that demonstrates how to compress an IPv6 address by omitting all zero segments as follows: Fully expanded, FE80:0000:0000:0000:0123:4567:89AB:CDEF. No leading zeroes, FE80:0:0:0:123:4567:89AB:CDEF Compressed, FE80::123:4567:89AB:CDEF.Figure 4 on this page is a diagram that demonstrates another example of how to compress an IPv6 address by omitting all zero segments as follows: Fully expanded, FF02:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001. No leading zeroes, FF02:0:0:0:0:0:1 Compressed, FF02::1.
