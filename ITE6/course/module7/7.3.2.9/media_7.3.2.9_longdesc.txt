Figure 1 on this page is a diagram that shows the perspective view and the front view of a Single-mode fiber (SMF) cable highlighting the following different layers: Polymeric coating, Glass Cladding 125 microns diameter, Glass Core = 9 microns. The figure also lists the following description of Single-mode fiber (SMF) cable: small core, less dispersion, suited for long distance applications, uses lasers as the light source, commonly used with campus backbones for distances of several thousand meters. Produces single straight path for light. Figure 2 on this page is a diagram that shows the perspective view and the front view of a Multi-mode fiber (MMF) cable highlighting the following different layers: Coating, Glass Cladding 125 microns diameter, Glass Core = 50/62.5 microns. The figure also lists the following description of Multi-mode fiber (MMF) cable: larger core than single mode cable, allows greater dispersion and therefore, loss of signal, suited for long distance applications, but shorter than single mode, uses LEDs as a light source, commonly used with LANs or distances of a couple hundred meters within a campus network. Allows multiple paths for light.
