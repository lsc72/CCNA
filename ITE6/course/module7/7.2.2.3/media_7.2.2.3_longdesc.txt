The figure on this page is a topology of the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) access control method. The topology shows three laptops connected to a central wireless router. One laptop has a callout that says, “I’m receiving this wireless frame.” The other two laptops have callouts that say, “I see in the wireless frame that the channel is going to be unavailable for a specific amount of time so I cannot send.”
