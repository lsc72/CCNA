The figure on this page is a diagram that shows the perspective view and the front view of a fibre-optic cable highlighting the following different layers. Jacket, typically a PVC jacket that protects the fiber against abrasion, moisture, and other contaminants. This outer jacket composition can vary depending on the cable usage. Strengthening Material, surrounds the buffer, prevents the fiber cable from being stretched when it is being pulled. The material used is often the same material used to produce bulletproof vests. Buffer, used to help shield the core and cladding from damage. Cladding, made from slightly different chemicals than those used to create the core. It tends to act like a mirror by reflecting light back into the core of the fiber. This keeps light in the core as it travels down the fiber. Core, the core is actually the light transmission element at the center of the optical fiber. This core is typically silica or glass. Light pulses travel through the fiber core.
