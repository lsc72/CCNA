The figure on this page is a topology that represents a metropolitan area network (MAN). The topology shows a group of buildings that are all interconnected to form a metropolitan area network (MAN). The image also shows that there are LANs in three of the buildings and that one of the buildings in the MAN is connected to another building that is not part of the MAN, forming a WAN.
