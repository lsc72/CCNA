The figure on this page is a diagram that shows how the following layers of the OSI and TCP/IP models compare. The key similarities are in the Transport and Network Layers; however, the two models differ in how they relate to the layers above and below each layer. OSI Layer Number: 7, OSI Layer: Application, TCP/IP Layer: Application. OSI Layer Number: 6, OSI Layer: Presentation, TCP/IP Layer: Application. OSI Layer Number: 5, OSI Layer: Session, TCP/IP Layer: Application. OSI Layer Number: 4, OSI Layer: Transport, TCP/IP Layer: Transport. OSI Layer Number: 3, OSI Layer: Network, TCP/IP Layer: Internet. OSI Layer Number: 2, OSI Layer: Data Link, TCP/IP Layer: Network Access. OSI Layer Number: 1, OSI Layer: Physical, TCP/IP Layer: Network Access.
