Figure 1 on this page is a table that shows the how following addresses were divided into three classes when IPv4 was first specified in 1981. In Network/Host, N = Network and H = Host. Class: A, First Octet: 0 – 127, Subnet Mask: 255.0.0.0, Network/Host: N,H,H,H, Number of Hosts per Network: 16777214. Class: B, First Octet: 128 – 191, Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0, Network/Host: N,N,H,H, Number of Hosts per Network: 65534. Class: C, First Octet: 192 - 223, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0, Network/Host: N,N,N,H, Number of Hosts per Network: 254. Figure 2 on this page is a table that shows subnet masks in prefix notation. Subnet Mask: 255.0.0.0, Binary: 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000, Prefix: /8. Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0, Binary: 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000, Prefix: /16. Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0, Binary: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000, Prefix: /24. Figure 3 on this page is a diagram that shows the following example of a Classless Inter-Domain Router (CIDR) supernet. An organization could receive the following four Class C network addresses with a custom subnet mask: 192.168.20.0/24, 192.168.21.0/24, 192.168.22.0/24, 192.168.23.0/24. The resulting network address is the following supernet: 192.168.20.0/22.
