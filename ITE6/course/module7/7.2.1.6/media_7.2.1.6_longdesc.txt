The figure on this page is an animation that shows an example of the following encapsulation process as a web server sends a web page to a web client. Step 1: the Transport Header is added to the data at the Transport Layer to form the TCP Segment. Step 2: the Network Header is added to the TCP Segment at the Network Layer to form the IP Packet. Step 3: the Frame Header and Frame Trailer are added to the IP Packet at the Data Link Layer to form the Ethernet Frame. Step 4: the Physical; Layer then sends the Ethernet Frame to the Web Client in the form of bits.
