Figure 1 on this page is a table listing the following characteristics of twisted-pair cable. Category: Cat 3 UTP, Speed: 10 Mb/s at 16 MHz, Features: Suitable for Ethernet LAN, most often used for phone lines. Category: Cat 5 UTP, Speed: 100 Mb/s at 100 MHz, Features: Manufactured with higher standard than Cat 3 to allow for higher data transfer rates. Category: Cat 5e UTP, Speed: 1000 Mb/s at 100 MHz, Features: Manufactured with higher standard than Cat 5 to allow for higher data transfer rates, more twists per foot than Cat 5 to better prevent EMI and RFI from outside sources. Category: Cat 6 UTP, Speed: 1000 Mb/s at 250 MHz. Category: Cat 6a UTP, Speed: 1000 Mb/s at 500 MHz. Category: Cat 7 ScTP, Speed: 10 Gb/s at 600 MHz, Features for Cat 6, 6a, and 7: Manufactured with higher standard than Cat 5e, more twists per foot than Cat 5e to better prevent EMI and RFI from outside sources, Cat 6a has better insulation and performance than Cat 6, may have a plastic divider to separate pairs of wires inside the cable to better prevent EMI and RFI, good choice for customers using applications that require large amounts of bandwidth, such as videoconferencing or gaming, ScTP (Screened Twisted-Pair) is very expensive and not as flexible as UTP.
