The figure on this page is an animation that shows how TCP segments and acknowledgments are transmitted between sender and receiver as follows. Step 1: A file is sent to a server using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) application. TCP tracks the conversation and segments the data to be sent into six segments. Step 2: The first three out of six segments are forwarded to the server. Step 3: The file server acknowledges the first three segments received. Step 4: The client forwards the next three segments. Step 5: No segments are received, no acknowledgment is sent. Step 6: The client resends the final three segments. Step 7: The final three segments are received and acknowledged.
