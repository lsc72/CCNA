The AP is connected to Switch1. A desktop computer is also connected to Switch1. Switch1 is connected to Switch2. Switch2 is connected to a router which is connected to the Internet using a serial connection. Devices interconnect using the services of an AP or wireless router. Figure 2 on this page is a topology that represents Ad Hoc Mode. A laptop is connected wirelessly to a smart phone, which is connected to the Internet through cellular service provider.
