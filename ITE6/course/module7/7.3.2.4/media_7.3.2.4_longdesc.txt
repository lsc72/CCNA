T568A wire colours: wire 1, green with white stripe, wire 2, solid green, wire 3, orange with white stripe, wire 4, solid blue, wire 5, blue with white stripe, wire 6, solid orange, wire 7, brown with white stripe, wire 8, solid brown, T568a pairs:, pair 1, wire 4 and wire 5, pair 2, wire 3 and wire 6, pair 3, wire 1 and wire 2, pair 4, wire 7 and wire 8, T568b wire colours:, wire 1, orange with white stripe, wire 2, solid orange, wire 3, green with white stripe, wire 4, solid blue, wire 5, blue with white stripe, wire 6, solid green, wire 7, brown with white stripe, wire 8, solid brown, T568b pairs:, pair 1, wire 4 and wire 5, pair 2, wire 1 and wire 2, pair 3, wire 3 and wire 6, pair 4, wire 7 and wire 8. The figure also shows a table listing the following differences between a straight-through cable and a crossover cable. Cable: Ethernet Straight-through cable, Standard: Both ends T568A or both ends T568B, Application: Connects a network host to a network device such as a switch or hub. Cable: Ethernet Crossover cable, Standard: One end T568A and the other end T568B, Application: Connects two network hosts, connects two network intermediary devices (switch to switch or router to router).
