The figure on this page shows images and descriptions of the following fiber-optic connectors: Straight-Tip (ST) Connectors, one of the first connector types used. The connector locks securely with a "twist-on/twist-off" bayonet style mechanism. Subscriber (SC) Connectors, sometimes referred to as square connector or standard connector. It is a widely adopted LAN and WAN connector that uses a push-pull mechanism to ensure positive insertion. This connector type is used with multimode and single-mode fiber. Lucent Connector (LC) Connectors, a smaller version of the fiber-optic SC connector. It is sometimes called a little or local connector and is quickly growing in popularity due to its smaller size. Duplex Multimode LC Connectors, similar to a LC simplex connector, but using a duplex connector.
