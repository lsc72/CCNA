Figure 1 on this page shows the following examples of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. IPv4 Address Format: 32 bits in dotted decimal notation, 192.168.200.8. IPv6 Address Format 128 bits in hexadecimal format, 2001:0DB8:CAFE:0200:0000:0000:0000:0008, IPv6 Address Format 128 bits in compressed format, 2001:DB8:CAFE:200::8. Figure 2 on this page is a topology that demonstrates that MAC addresses do not change when a device is moved but IP addresses do change. The topology shows two LANs, LAN1 and LAN2. Both LANs consist of two desktop computers and a wireless access point connected to a switch. The LANs are connected by a router. A laptop was originally on LAN1 with the following addresses: MAC, 00-50-56-BE-D7-87; IPv4, 192.168.200.8; IPv6, 2001:db8:cafe:200::8. After the laptop is moved to LAN2 it has the following address: MAC, 00-50-56-BE-D7-87; IPv4, 192.168.300.8; IPv6, 2001:db8:cafe:300::8. Figure 3 on this page is an image of the Command Line Interface (CLI) output for the ipconfig /all command on the laptop. Included in the output are the MAC address and the two IP addresses.
