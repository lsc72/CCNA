Figure 1 on this page is a diagram that shows the different pairs of copper wires in a twisted-pair cable. Each wire in a twisted pair is encased in colour-coded insulation and twisted together. The outer jacket of the cable protects the copper wire from physical damage. The colour-coded plastic insulation electrically isolates wires from each other and identifies each pair. Each twisted pair protects the signal from interference. Figure 2 on this page is a diagram that shows the following layers of a twisted-pair cable: jacket, braided or foil shield (protects all the twisted-pairs), foil shields (protects each set of twisted-pairs), and twisted-pairs. Figure 3 on this page shows an image of an RJ-45 UTP cable showing the RJ 45 connector. The figure also shows an image of 4 RJ-45 UTP sockets.
