Figure 1 on this page is an image that shows a degaussing wand being applied to the exposed hard drive platters. Figure 2 on this page is a table that lists the following methods for wiping data from a hard disk drive. Method: Data Wiping, Description: Useful when needing to occasionally wipe a drive, software tool takes a long time to erase a disk, tool may offer multiple data overwriting choices including using special patterns of ones and zeros, mathematical algorithms, and random bits, data wiping tools are available for free. Method: Degaussing Wand, Description: Useful when needing to occasionally wipe a drive, hard drive platters must be exposed to the wand for approximately two minutes, costs much less than an electromagnetic degaussing device. Method: Electromagnetic Degaussing Device, Description: Useful to bulk erase multiple drives, degaussing devices take very little time, for example,  10 seconds to wipeout a hard drive, a degaussing tool can be very expensive, for example US $20,000.
