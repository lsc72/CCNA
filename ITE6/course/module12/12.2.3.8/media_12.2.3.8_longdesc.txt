Figure 1 on this page is a table that lists the following data wiping methods. Method: Standard Format, Description: Also called high-level formatting, a boot sector is created and a file system is set up on the disk. A standard format can only be performed after a low-level format has been completed. Method: Low-Level Format, Description: The surface of the disk is marked with sector markers to indicate where data will be stored physically on the disk, and tracks are created, low-level formatting is most often performed at the factory after the hard drive is built. Figure 2 on this page is an image of a hard drive being physically destroyed by using a hammer.
