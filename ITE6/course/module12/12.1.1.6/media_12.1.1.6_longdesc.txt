The figure on this page is an interactive activity that checks the learnerâ€™s understanding of TCP/IP attacks. Man-in-the-Middle, an attacker intercepts communications between computers to steal information transiting through the network. DoS, this type of attack creates an abnormally large amount of requests to network servers which overwhelms the server. Spoofing, a computer uses a forged IP or MAC address to pretend to be a trusted computer to gain access to resources. Replay, data transmissions are intercepted and recorded by an attacker. They are then sent to the destination computer. The destination computer handles these transmissions as though they are authentic. Syn Flood, this attack randomly opens TCP ports at the source of the attack with a large amount of false SYN requests. This causes sessions to be denied to others.
