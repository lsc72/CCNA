Figure 1 on this page is a topology that demonstrates hash encoding. The topology shows two desktop computers connected over the Internet. One computer has a callout that says, “Here is the quote you requested”. Sender enters message to be hash encoded. The message is transmitted over the network (secure or unsecure). The hash algorithm (SHA or MD5) produces a message digest, ‘A7DE89DCA00AC8…’ The sender sends the message digest along with the message. The receiver recovers the sent message. The receiver’s hash algorithm produces a message digest. If the two message digests are not identical, the message has been changed or tampered with. Figure 2 on this page is a topology that demonstrates symmetric encryption. The topology shows two desktop computers connected over the Internet. One computer has a callout that says, “Here is the quote you requested”. The sender enters the message to be encrypted. The sender enters secret encryption key to encode the message, ‘A7DE89DCA00AC8…’ The sender sends the message over an unsecure network. The receiver enters identical secret key to decode the encrypted message. The receiver recovers the decrypted message. Figure 3 on this page is a topology that demonstrates asymmetric encryption. The topology shows two desktop computers connected over the Internet. One computer has a callout that says, “Here is the quote you requested”. Sender enters message to be encrypted. The sender enters the receiver’s public key to encode the message, ‘1AG65B00BDE735… The sender sends the message over an unsecure network. The receiver enters the security private key to decode the message, ‘1BAF55D000EF795…’ The receiver recovers the sent message. The receiver recovers the message.
