Figure 1 on this page is an image that shows a technician verifying that the CPU being installed is compatible with the motherboard socket. Figure 2 on this page is a table listing the following CPU architectures and relevant installation notes. Single-Edge Connector (SEC), align the notches on the CPU to the keys in the SEC socket. Low-Insertion Force (LIF), align the CPU so that the connection 1 indicator is lined up with pin 1 on the CPU socket. Zero-Insertion Force (ZIF), align the CPU so that the connection 1 indicator is lined up with pin 1 on the CPU socket. Pin Grid Array PGA), align the CPU so that the connection 1 indicator is lined up with pin 1 on the CPU socket. Land Grid Array (LGA), align the CPU so that the two notches on the CPU fit into the two socket extensions. Figure 3 on this page is an image that shows the technician aligning the CPU with the socket. Figure 4 on this page is an image that shows the technician closing the CPU latch plate. Figure 5 on this page is an image that shows the technician closing the load lever to secure the CPU latch plate. Figure 6 on this page is an image that shows the load lever secured under the load lever retention tab. Figure 7 on this page is an image that shows the technician applying thermal compound to the CPU. Figure 8 on this page is an image that shows the technician installing the heat sink and fan assembly onto the CPU socket.
