Figure 1 on this page is a table that lists the following Bluetooth characteristics. A short range wireless technology designed to eliminate the need for cables between portable or fixed-configuration devices. Operates at 2.4 to 2.485 GHz in the unlicensed Industrial, Scientific, and Medical band. Low power, low cost, and small size. Uses adaptive frequency hopping. Version 1.2 operates up to 1.2 Mbps. Version 2.0 + Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) operates at up to 3 Mbps. Version 3.0 + High Speed (HS) operates at up to 24 Mbps. Version 4.0 + Low Energy (LE) operates at up to 24 Mbps, also called Bluetooth Smart. Version 4.0 has added technology to support products that use very little energy, called Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Version 4.1 is an update to improve things such as co â€“ existence with mobile wireless service. Version 4.2 added support for technology needed by Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Figure 2 on this page is a table that lists the following Bluetooth Classifications. Class: Class 1, maximum permitted power mW: 100 mW, approximate distance: 330 feet (100 meters). Class: Class 2, maximum permitted power mW: 2.5 mW, approximate distance: 33 feet (10 meters). Class: Class 3, maximum permitted power mW: 1 mW, approximate distance: 3 feet (1 meter).Figure 3 on this page is a table that lists the following Bluetooth Specifications.
