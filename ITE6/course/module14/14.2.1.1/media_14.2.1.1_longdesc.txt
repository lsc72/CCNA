Figure 2 on this page is a table that lists the following advanced problems and solutions for operating systems. Identify the Problem: The computer displays an “Invalid Boot Disk” error after POST. Probable Causes: Media that does not have an operating system is in a drive, the boot order is not set correctly in the BIOS/UEFI settings, the hard drive is not detected, the hard drive does not have an operating system installed, The MBR/GPT is corrupted, the computer has a boot sector virus, the hard drive is failing. Possible Solutions: Remove all media from the drives, change the boot order in the BIOS/UEFI settings to start with the boot drive, reconnect the hard drive cables, install an operating system, use the, ‘bootrec /fixmbr’ command from the System Recovery options of Windows 7 or Vista, run virus removal software, replace the hard drive. Identify the Problem: The computer displays an “Inaccessible Boot Device” error after the POST, Probable Causes: A recently installed device driver is incompatible with the boot controller, BOOTMGR is corrupted, Possible Solutions: Use the last known good configuration to boot the computer, boot the computer to safe mode and load a restore point from before the installation of new hardware. Identify the Problem: the computer displays a “BOOTMGR is missing” error after the POST, Probable Causes: BOOTMGR is missing or damaged, the boot order is not set correctly in the BIOS/UEFI settings, the MBR/GPT is corrupted, the hard drive is failing, Possible Solutions: Restore BOOTMGR using the Windows Recovery Environment, change the boot order in the BIOS settings to start with the boot drive, run the, ‘chkdsk /F /R’ command from the recovery console. Identify the Problem: A service failed to start when the computer booted, Probable Causes: The service is not enabled, the service is set to Manual and the failed service requires another service to be enabled, Possible Solutions: Enable the service, set the service to Automatic and re-enable the required service. Identify the Problem: A device did not start when the computer booted, Probable Causes: The device has been disabled in the BIOS settings, the device has a conflict with a newly installed device, the driver is corrupted, Possible Solutions: Enable the device in the BIOS settings, remove the newly installed device, re-install or roll back the driver. Identify the Problem: A program listed in the registry is not found, Probable Causes: The uninstall program did not work correctly, the hard drive has become corrupted, the computer has a virus, Possible Solutions: Re-install the program and run the uninstall program again, run the, ‘chkdsk /F /R’ command to fix the hard drive file entries, scan for and remove the virus. Identify the Problem: The computer continually restarts without displaying the desktop, Probable Causes: The computer is set to restart when there is a failure, a startup file has become corrupted, Possible Solutions: Press F8 to open the Advanced Options Menu and choose Disable automatic restart on system failure, Run the, ‘chkdsk /F /R’ command from the Recovery Environment, run the Automatic Repair from the Recovery Environment in Windows 8. Identify the Problem: The computer displays a black or blue screen of death (BSOD), Probable Causes: A driver is not compatible with the hardware, there is a hardware failure, Possible Solutions: Research the STOP error and the name of the module that produced the error, replace any failing devices with known-good devices. Identify the Problem: The computer locks up without any error messages, Probable Causes: The CPU or FSB settings are incorrect on the motherboard or in the BIOS settings, the computer is overheating, an update has corrupted the operating system, there is a hardware failure, the computer has a virus, Possible Solutions: Check and reset the CPU and FSB settings, check and replace any cooling devices as necessary, uninstall the software update or perform a System Restore, run the,’ chkdsk /F /R’ command from the Recovery Environment, replace any failing devices with known-good devices, scan for and remove the virus. Identify the Problem: An application does not install, Probable Causes: The installation application is not compatible with the operating system, Possible Solutions: Run the installation application under compatibility mode. Identify the Problem: The search feature takes a long time to find results, Probable Causes: The index service is not running, the index service is not indexing in the correct locations, Possible Solutions: Start the index services using services.msc, change the settings of the index service in the Advanced Options panel. Identify the Problem: The computer is running slowly and has a delayed response, Probable Causes: A process is using most of the CPU resources, Possible Solutions: Restart the process with services.msc, if the process is not needed, end the process with Task Manager, restart the computer. Identify the Problem: When you run a program, a missing or corrupt DLL message is displayed, Probable Causes: One or more programs using the DLL file were uninstalled and removed the DLL file that was needed by another program, the DLL file was corrupted during a bad installation, Possible Solutions: Reinstall the program that has a missing or corrupt DLL file, reinstall the application that uninstalled the DLL, run the, ‘sfc /scannow’ command in Safe Mode. Identify the Problem: RAID is not detected during installation, Probable Causes: Windows does not include the proper drivers to recognise RAID, RAID settings in BIOS/UEFI are incorrect, Possible Solutions: Install the proper drivers, change settings in BIOS/UEFI to enable RAID. Identify the Problem: A system file is corrupted, Probable Causes: Computer was shut down improperly, Possible Solutions: Repair your computer from the Advanced Startup Options Menu, boot computer in Safe Mode and run the, ‘sfc /scannow’ command. Identify the Problem: Computer boots to Safe Mode, Probable Causes: The computer has been configured to boot in Safe Mode, Possible Solutions: Use msconfig to adjust the startup settings for the program.
