Figure 1 on this page shows images of the following three printers: a dot matrix printer, an ink jet printer, and a laser printer. Figure 2 on this page is an image of a CMYK colour wheel. The colour wheel shows the following groups of colours clockwise from the top: Purple, pink, red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, dark blue. Each colour group consists of small tiles of different shades of the main colour. The tiles spiral into the center of the wheel with the darkest shades on the outside of the wheel with the other tiles progressively getting lighter towards the center of the wheel which is white. The figure also shows a greyscale slider and edit boxes for entering RGB colour codes, CMYK colour codes, and Hexadecimal colour codes.
