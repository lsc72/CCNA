The figure on this page is a diagram that represents a logical virtual machine. Three boxes aligned horizontally are each labelled as, ‘Virtual Machine’. Each of the virtual machines contains two smaller boxes stacked vertically and labelled as, ‘Applications on Guest OS’ and ‘Guest OS’. Below the three virtual machines is a larger box the width of the three virtual machines. This box is labelled as, ‘Physical Machine’. The physical machine contains two smaller boxes, also the width of the three virtual machines, stacked vertically and labelled as, ‘Virtualization Software (Hyper-V, Virtual PC, VirtualBox, etc)’ and ‘Host OS’.
