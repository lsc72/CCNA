The box contains three smaller boxes aligned horizontally each labelled as, ‘OS’. Below the three OS boxes is a larger box the width of the three OS boxes. This box is labelled as, ‘Hypervisor’. Below the Hypervisor is another box, the same width as the Hypervisor, labelled as, ‘Hardware’. The second diagram represents a Type 2 Hosted hypervisor. It is similar to the Type 1 diagram but the main box is labelled as, ‘Host’ instead of ‘Server’. This box has the same contents as the Type 1 diagram with an extra box between the hypervisor and the hardware. The extra box is labelled as, ‘Operating System’.Figure 2 on this page is an image of the Windows Features utility with the Hyper-V option highlighted.Figure 3 on this page is an image of the Hyper-V Manager utility in Windows 8.
